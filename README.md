### What I learned

Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights and improved my skills in several areas:

I feel that I started off on the wrong foot with this project. I should have taken a mobile-first approach, but instead, I went with a desktop-first approach, which was regrettable. However, I'm really proud that I didn't give up or restart the project; I saw it through to the end. Despite making things more complicated than necessary, I gained a lot from the experience. Next time, I'll spend more time carefully analyzing the design and planning how to implement it more thoughtfully.

These learnings have not only improved my technical skills but also given me a clearer direction for future growth and areas to focus on in upcoming projects.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on and improving in these areas:

1. Before starting the project, I plan to carefully choose between a desktop-first and a mobile-first approach. The decision will be based on the similarity of the design across different platforms.

2. As the number of components and sections increased, I found it increasingly difficult to manage the UI even without handling state. While it's not an immediate issue, I realize the importance of testing in frontend development. I need to learn how to effectively implement testing.

By focusing on these areas, I hope to continually improve my front-end development skills and create more efficient and sophisticated web applications.
